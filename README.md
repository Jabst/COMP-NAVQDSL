**Summary**
Our tool enables the user to specify routes and places through a natural language like manner. We use a Java server that runs the parser and a web interface to be used as a user interface to receive the user input and show the query results.

Our language handles all the possible options that the google maps api offers, we also integrated the places api.

**Dealing with Syntactic Errors**
If the tool detects syntactic errors it returns to the user an error message, specifying what went wrong.

**Semantic Analysis**
We analysed the google API and identified some semantic errors that we would need to be aware of:
* specifying multiple means of transport, multiple by definitions.
* specifying multiple locations for places, multiple near definitions.
* LESS_WALKING, FEWER_TRANSFERS optimization options can only be used when the means of transport is Transit as well as the options ARRIVAL_TIME and DEPARTURE_TIME.
* OPTIMIZE_ROUTE option can only be used if the user defines two or more waypoints.


**Intermediate Representations (IRs)**
Using the interface it is possible to visualize the intermediate representation tree generated for the provided input.

**OVERVIEW**
Our tool is divided in three major parts, the parser, the server and the web interface.
We use a json java library to create json objects to respond to the requests, Treant.js used to visualize the AST generated by the user input and raphael.js necessary to use the google maps API.

**Task Distribution**

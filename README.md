### Summary
Our tool enables the user to specify routes and places through a natural language like manner. We use a Java server that runs the parser and a web interface to be used as a user interface to receive the user input and show the query results.

Our language handles all the possible options that the Google maps _API_ offers, we also integrated the places _API_.

### Dealing with Syntactic Errors
If the tool detects syntactic errors it returns to the user an error message, specifying what went wrong.

### Semantic Analysis
We analysed the Google _API_ and identified some semantic errors that we would need to be aware of:
* specifying multiple means of transport, multiple by definitions.
* specifying multiple locations for places, multiple near definitions.
* LESS_WALKING, FEWER_TRANSFERS optimization options can only be used when the means of transport is Transit as well as the options ARRIVAL_TIME and DEPARTURE_TIME.
* OPTIMIZE_ROUTE option can only be used if the user defines two or more waypoints.


### Intermediate Representations (IRs)
Using the interface it is possible to visualize the intermediate representation tree generated for the provided input.

### Overview
Our tool is divided in three major parts, the parser, the server and the web interface.
We use a _JSON_ java library to create _JSON_ objects to respond to the requests, Treant.js used to visualize the _AST_ generated by the user input and raphael.js necessary to use the Google maps _API_.
